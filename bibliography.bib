@article{Perez_Nilsson_2017, title={Testing and debugging functional reactive programming}, volume={1}, ISSN={2475-1421}, DOI={10.1145/3110246}, abstractNote={Many types of interactive applications, including video games, raise particular challenges when it comes to testing and debugging. Reasons include de-facto lack of reproducibility and difficulties of automatically generating suitable test data. This paper demonstrates that certain variants of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) implemented in pure functional languages can mitigate such difficulties by offering referential transparency at the level of whole programs. This opens up for a multi-pronged approach for assisting with testing and debugging that works across platforms, including assertions based on temporal logic, recording and replaying of runs (also from deployed code), and automated random testing using QuickCheck. The approach has been validated on real, non-trivial games implemented in the FRP system Yampa through a tool providing a convenient Graphical User Interface that allows the execution of the code under scrutiny to be controlled, moving along the execution time line, and pin-pointing of violations of assertions on PCs as well as mobile platforms.}, number={ICFP}, journal={Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages}, author={Perez, Ivan and Nilsson, Henrik}, year={2017}, month={Aug}, pages={1–27} }

  abstractnote = {The ability to record and replay program executions with low overhead enables many applications, such as reverse-execution debugging, debugging of hard-to-reproduce test failures, and “black box” forensic analysis of failures in deployed systems. Existing record-and-replay approaches limit deployability by recording an entire virtual machine (heavyweight), modifying the OS kernel (adding deployment and maintenance costs), requiring pervasive code instrumentation (imposing significant performance and complexity overhead), or modifying compilers and runtime systems (limiting generality). We investigated whether it is possible to build a practical record-and-replay system avoiding all these issues. The answer turns out to be yes - if the CPU and operating system meet certain non-obvious constraints. Fortunately modern Intel CPUs, Linux kernels and user-space frameworks do meet these constraints, although this has only become true recently. With some novel optimizations, our system ‘rr’ records and replays real-world low-parallelism workloads with low overhead, with an entirely user-space implementation, using stock hardware, compilers, runtimes and operating systems. “rr” forms the basis of an open-source reverse-execution debugger seeing significant use in practice. We present the design and implementation of ‘rr’, describe its performance on a variety of workloads, and identify constraints on hardware and operating system design required to support our approach.},

  abstractnote = {RxJS is a popular library to implement data-flow-oriented applications with JavaScript using reactive programming principles. This way of programming bears new challenges for traditional debuggers: Their focus on imperative programming limits their applicability to problems originated in the declarative programming paradigm. The goals of this paper are: (i) to understand how software engineers debug RxJS-based applications, what tools do they use, what techniques they apply; (ii) to understand what are the most prevalent challenges they face while doing so; and (iii) to provide a course of action to resolve these challenges in a future iteration on the topic. We learned about the debugging habits of ten professionals using interviews, and hands-on war story reports. Based on this data, we designed and executed an observational study with four subjects to verify that engineers predominantly augment source code with manual trace logs instead of using specialized debugging utilities. In the end, we identified the lack of fully integrated RxJS-specific debugging solutions in existing development environments as the most significant reason why engineers do not make use of such tools. We decided to elaborate on how to resolve this situation in our future work.},

  title        = {From Debugging Towards Live Tuning of Reactive Applications},
  abstractnote = {Directly visualizing the effect of changes to applications improves developers productivity as they gain immediate insights on the resulting application behavior. Yet, immediate feedback requires a representation of the dataflow in the application to correctly propagate and apply the effect of the changes.
Reactive programming is a programming paradigm which di- rectly expresses applications dataflow in a declarative way. Recently, researchers developed dedicated debugging techniques for reactive programming that use the dataflow graph to enable inspections and visualization.
In this paper, we adopt reactive debugging as a basis for live modifications and tuning of reactive applications. To this end we extend the debugger to allow live modifications to the dataflow graph in a structured manner to change the application behavior. We also suggest how developers of reactive applications can use such extension to enable flexible tuning of applications at run time. Our early experience shows that the combination of reactive pro- gramming and live programming allows modifications and tuning of applications while ensuring safety and consistency guarantees.},
