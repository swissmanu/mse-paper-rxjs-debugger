# Live Debugging for RxJS-based Applications

## Outline

- Introduction
	- Data flow programming, reactive programming
	- Input and output known
	- No idea what's happening in between (reference to data and semantic transparency, "Transparency and Liveness in Visual Programming Environments for Novices")
	- This is a problem for beginners as well as professionals
	- We verified that that this is a problem
	- We verified that devs sprinkle print statements (reference to "Transparency and Liveness in Visual Programming Environments for Novices" and others from earlier)
	- We present a solution: Visual Studio Code Extension for RxJS-based Applications
		- Augment code without changing it
		- Live response on what is happening in the application
- Related Work
	- Affordances in live programming environments
	- Scala Worksheets, Swift Playground, Wallaby.js
	- Reactive Debugger for REScala (Visualization! <3)
	- RxFiddle
	- rxjs-playground https://github.com/hediet/rxjs-playground
- How it came to be
	- Previous Work
		- Interviews
		- Observational Study
	- Prototype
	- UX Testing of Prototype
- Result
	- Show case Visual Studio Code Extension
	- Open Question/Idea: Can we demonstrate somehow an example with hot code reloading, so we have a better "live" experience?
- Future Work
	- Feature Completeness with Browser Application Debugging
	- Visualization of data flows
	- Ideas:
		- Verify if extension helps beginners to learn RxJS
		- Verify effectiveness of extension for professionals
- Conclusion
	- Wrap things up
