# Abstract
abstract: |
  Debugging reactive data-flow-oriented applications is a cumbersome task. Unfortunately, modern development environments provide only suitable tools to debug control-flow-oriented programs. As a result, software engineers utilizing RxJS, a popular library for reactive programming in JavaScript, remain using inapt debugging tools, utilities outside of their accustomed IDE, or antiquated debugging practices like manual print statements. This paper presents two contributions to reactive debugging for RxJS: (i) Operator log points, a novel debugging utility for reactive programming, make manual print statements obsolete. By integrating them fully with Microsoft Visual Studio Code, (ii) we ensure readiness-to-hand and never interrupt the engineers' debugging process.
