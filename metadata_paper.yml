# Abstract
abstract: |
 Debugging reactive data-flow-oriented applications is a cumbersome task. Unfortunately, modern development environments provide only suitable tools to debug control-flow-oriented programs. As a result, software engineers utilizing RxJS, a popular library for reactive programming in JavaScript, remain obligated to use inapt debugging tools, antiquated debugging practices like manual print statements, or utilities outside of their accustomed IDE. This paper presents two contributions to reactive debugging for RxJS: (i) Operator log points make manual print statements obsolete. Ready-to-hand, the debugging utility is fully integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio Code without interrupting the engineers' workflow. Furthermore, the proposed debugger (ii) uses an advanced system architecture. As a result, it simplifies how the components communicate at runtime by reusing already established communication channels using the Chrome DevTools Protocol. We facilitated usability inspection and validation methods in an iterative, user-centered design approach to build the demonstrated debugging utility. We will exhibit the results of these iterations and briefly introduce the future of the presented debugging solution for RxJS.
