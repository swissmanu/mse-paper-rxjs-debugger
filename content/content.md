# Introduction

- Data flow/reactive programming with RxJS
- Input and output known
- No idea what's happening in between -> Relate with [@Tanimoto_2015]
- We verified this is a real problem
- We verified that devs sprinkle print statements -> Relate with[@Tanimoto_2015]
	- This holds for novice and professional software engineers
- We have a solution: Visual Studio Code Extension for RxJS-based Applications

# Related Work

- Types of debuggers (imperative, reactive [@Salvaneschi_Mezini_2016], omniscient [@Pothier_Tanter_2009] [@OCallahan_Jones_Froyd_Huey_Noll_Partush_2017])
- Affordances in live programming environments [@Tanimoto_2013]
- Scala Worksheets, Swift Playground, Wallaby.js
- Reactive Inspector [@Salvaneschi_Mezini_2016] for REScala (Visualization! <3)

# Research

- Previous Work [@Alabor_Stolze_2020]
  - Interviews
  - Observational Study
- New work:
	- Prototype
	- UX Testing of Prototype [@Alabor_2020]
	- The Result: An extension for Visual Studio Code, as described in the next section:

# Implementation

- Demonstrate/describe Extension
  - Log Points -> Relate with probes/traces [@McDirmid_2013]
- Categorize Extension in terms of "Levels of Live" [@Tanimoto_2013]
- *Idea: Can we demonstrate somehow an example with hot code reloading, so we have a better "live" experience?*

# Future Work

- Features:
	- Support for Browser-based Applications (Selling point: Angular)
	- Visualization of data flows
	- Omniscient/time travel debugging for data flows
- Research:
  - Verify if extension helps beginners to get started with RxJS
  - Verify effectiveness of extension for professionals (re-execute previous observational study)
  - More Usability Testing

# Conclusion

- Wrap things up
