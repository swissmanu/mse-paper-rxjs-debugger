# Introduction

- Data flow/reactive programming with RxJS
- Input and output known
- No idea what's happening in between (reference to data and semantic transparency, "Transparency and Liveness in Visual Programming Environments for Novices")
- We verified this is a real problem
- We verified that devs sprinkle print statements (reference to "Transparency and Liveness in Visual Programming Environments for Novices" and others from earlier)
	- This holds for novice and professional software engineers
- We have a solution: Visual Studio Code Extension for RxJS-based Applications

# Related Work

- Types of debuggers (imperative, reactive, omniscient)
- Affordances in live programming environments
- Scala Worksheets, Swift Playground, Wallaby.js
- Reactive Debugger for REScala (Visualization! <3)
- *Optional: RxFiddle*
- *Optional: rxjs-playground https://github.com/hediet/rxjs-playground*

# Research

- Previous Work
  - Interviews
  - Observational Study
- New work:
	- Prototype
	- UX Testing of Prototype
	- The Result: An extension for Visual Studio Code, as described in the next section:

# Implementation

- Demonstrate/describe Extension
- Categorize Extension in terms of "Levels of Live" (reference A Perspective on the Evolution of Live Programming)
- *Idea: Can we demonstrate somehow an example with hot code reloading, so we have a better "live" experience?*

# Future Work

- Features:
	- Support for Browser-based Applications (Selling point: Angular)
	- Visualization of data flows
	- Omniscient/time travel debugging for data flows
- Research:
  - Verify if extension helps beginners to get started with RxJS
  - Verify effectiveness of extension for professionals (re-execute previous observational study)
  - More Usability Testing

# Conclusion

- Wrap things up
